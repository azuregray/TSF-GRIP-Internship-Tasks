# TSF GRIP Internship Showcase

Welcome to my internship showcase as part of the **Graduate Rotational Internship Programme** with [The Sparks Foundation](https://www.thesparksfoundationsingapore.org/). 

In this repository, I present two significant tasks I accomplished during my internship:

## Task 1: Object Recognition

For this task, I implemented cutting-edge techniques in **object recognition**. The results and details can be found in the respective task folder.

## Task 2: Color Identification in Images or Video

In my second task, I delved into the world of **color identification** in images and videos. The code and outcomes are available in the respective project directory.

I'm excited to share the outcomes of both tasks, and I encourage you to explore the projects in detail.
Additionally, you can watch my video demonstration of these tasks on my [YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/@thedarshgowda).

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or feedback.
Sincerely thank you for reviewing my internship work!
