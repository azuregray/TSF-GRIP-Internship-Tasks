## Object Detection Model (ODM)

This repository contains Python code for object detection and recognition using a pre-trained deep learning model.
The code uses the following libraries and techniques:

- OpenCV (`cv2`) for image and video processing.
- Matplotlib (`matplotlib`) for visualization.
- A pre-trained deep learning model for object detection.
- Class labels for recognizing objects.

### Usage

1. Specify the configuration file (`config_file`) and frozen model file (`frozen_model`) for the pre-trained model.
2. Load class labels from a text file (`file_name`) to recognize objects.
3. Configure model input size, scaling, and color format.
4. Load an image or a video for object detection and recognition.
5. Display the recognized objects, their bounding boxes, and confidence scores.
6. For video, real-time object detection and recognition are performed.

### TL;DR 

> The code uses a pre-trained model to detect and recognize objects in an image and a video stream.

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`cv2`)
- Matplotlib (`matplotlib`)
